# LLM Onboarding

Quick reference for AI assistants working on this repository.

> **For project-specific technical context** (the four proof architectures, the Davenport-Heilbronn discipline, file-naming conventions, the LFunction interface, math style), see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md). This file focuses on the human-side context: about the owner, tech stack, and conventions.

## Project Overview

**Name:** Riemann Zeta Function — Deep Study Repo
**Purpose:** Multi-level exploration of the Riemann zeta function and Riemann Hypothesis, from intuitive to research-level, with manim visualizations and a computational experimental thread organized around testing the four candidate RH proof architectures.

**START HERE for research strategy:** [`docs/research_atlas/README.md`](docs/research_atlas/README.md) — comprehensive catalog of all approaches, what failed, what's missing, with a companion section pointing to the experiments.

**START HERE for experiments:** [`experiments/PROOF_ARCHITECTURES_PLAN.md`](experiments/PROOF_ARCHITECTURES_PLAN.md) — the test plan with current status per architecture.

## About the Owner

I'm Owen — a wheelchair user with muscular dystrophy.

- **Typing is hard** — Be proactive. Make decisions. Don't ask for confirmation on small things.
- **Offer A/B/C choices** — I can type one letter instead of explaining.
- **PowerShell on Windows** — Use PowerShell syntax. Prefer single-line commands.
- **Accessibility matters** — Many of my projects are tools I actually need.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Visualization:** manim (3Blue1Brown) — `pip install manim`
- **Docs:** Markdown with LaTeX math (`$...$` inline, `$$...$$` block)

## Math Notation

Use standard LaTeX in Markdown:
- Inline: `$\zeta(s)$`
- Block: `$$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}$$`
