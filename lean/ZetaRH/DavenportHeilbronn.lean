The Davenport-Heilbronn L-function and its known off-line zeros.

D-H is defined as the linear combination

  L_DH(s) = c * L(s, χ) + c̄ * L(s, χ̄)

where χ is a fixed non-real Dirichlet character mod 5 and c is chosen so that
the combination satisfies the functional equation of the SAME shape as ζ(s)
(real coefficients in the Dirichlet series, conductor 5, weight 0) WITHOUT
admitting an Euler product. The explicit normalisation:

  with χ(1)=1, χ(2)=i, χ(3)=-i, χ(4)=-1 (mod 5),
  c = (1 - i tan(θ)) / 2  with  tan(θ) = (√10 - √(10 - 2√5)) / (√5 - 1).

(See Titchmarsh 1986 §10.25 and Conrey-Ghosh 1988 for the explicit constant.)

The first off-line zero is approximately ρ ≈ 0.8085 + 85.6993 i, with the
functional-equation partner at 0.1915 + 85.6993 i.

D-H is the project's "wrong-approach detector": any Arch 1 / 3 / 4 method that
does not distinguish ζ from D-H is structurally wrong.

Status (Phase 1 substrate, 2026-05-25 onwards):

  - `chi_5` is the chosen non-real Dirichlet character mod 5, expressed via a
    `ZMod 5 → ℂ` function lifted to `ℕ → ℂ`.
  - `dhCoefficient` is the c-shaped linear-combination scalar (concrete real
    number; VERIFIER target #DH-c to verify against Conrey-Ghosh 1988).
  - `davenportHeilbronnTerm` is the Dirichlet-series coefficient sequence
    `n ↦ c · χ(n) + c̄ · χ̄(n)`, which is real-valued.
  - `davenportHeilbronnSeries` is the formal Dirichlet series; convergence on
    `Re s > 1` is VERIFIER target #DH-conv.
  - `davenport_heilbronn` is the `LFunction` wrapper.
  - `dh_first_offline_zero` is the numerical zero (constants pulled from
    `experiments/_shared/davenport_heilbronn.py`).
  - `dh_RH_false` is the structural negation of RH for D-H; the proof needs
    `dh_first_offline_zero ∈ nonTrivialZeros davenport_heilbronn`, which is
    VERIFIER target #DH-zero (currently `sorry`, but the proof skeleton is in
    place).

/-! ### The Dirichlet character χ mod 5.

    `χ(0) = 0, χ(1) = 1, χ(2) = i, χ(3) = -i, χ(4) = -1`. This is one of the
    two non-real characters mod 5; the other is its conjugate `χ̄`. -/

/-! ### The D-H linear-combination scalar c.

    Conrey-Ghosh 1988 give `c = (1 - i tan(θ)) / 2` with
    `tan(θ) = (√10 - √(10 - 2√5)) / (√5 - 1)`. The key property of c is that
    `c · χ(n) + c̄ · χ̄(n) ∈ ℝ` for all n (automatic) and the combined
    Dirichlet series satisfies the functional equation of the same shape as
    ζ at conductor 5. -/

    Convergence on `Re s > 1` is VERIFIER target #DH-conv. The continuation
    to the rest of `ℂ` is constructed from the Hurwitz zeta function via the

/-! ### Hurwitz-zeta decomposition (sketch).

    The continuation of `davenportHeilbronnSeries` to `ℂ \ {1}` (and in fact
    to all of `ℂ`, since the pole at s = 1 cancels in the combination) goes
    via the standard formula

      L(s, χ) = q^{-s} * ∑_{r=1}^{q-1} χ(r) * ζ(s, r/q)

    where `ζ(s, a)` is the Hurwitz zeta function. Mathlib has the Hurwitz
    zeta function under `Mathlib.NumberTheory.LSeries.HurwitzZeta`; building
    out the decomposition lemma is VERIFIER target #DH-cont. -/
